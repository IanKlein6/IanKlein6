# Hey there,   I'm Ian 👋

**Full-Stack Software Developer | Building Sustainable Solutions**

I'm a self-taught developer who transitioned from ecological construction to software engineering, bringing a unique perspective on building robust, scalable systems. I specialize in Full stack development, specializing in Python backend development with FastAPI and Django, coupled with modern React frontends. My journey includes a fascinating shift from ecological construction to tech, giving me a unique perspective on innovation and sustainability.
Currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.

**What drives me:**
- Exploring new technologies and tackling complex challenges.
- Contributing to projects that make a difference in energy sustainability.
- Architecting clean, maintainable backend systems with proper separation of concerns
- Writing comprehensive tests and documentation that make codebases approachable
- Continuous learning and applying my knowledge in practical settings.
